This project has been discontinued as it provides no value to anyone or anything.

Either the scope needs to be increased to cover all uses, or it needs to cease existing as this project would, in laymans terms, only serve to act as a script-like interface for Magick.NET. Any potential/further development regarding this project should be ceased immediately, and efforts should go towards developing / assisting development of Magick.NET.
